# Vivado Project Archive

1. We created an archive of the cobs_decoder project (File >> Project >> Archive) 
2. We de-selected Include run results (this means we do not include previous synthesis data in this Archive)
3. de-Zip the archive in this folder on your PC and run the Project file (.xpr) from Vivado. You should be able to open the cobs_decoder project.
